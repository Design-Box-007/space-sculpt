        </ul>

        <h2 className="custom-h2">Types of Lighting in Interior Fit-Outs</h2>
        <p className="custom-p">
          Understanding the main types of lighting helps in creating layered lighting plans that enhance both form and
          function.
        </p>
        <p className="custom-p">
          <strong>Ambient Lighting:</strong> This is the general lighting that provides overall illumination. It ensures
          a consistent level of light throughout the space and creates a welcoming atmosphere.
        </p>
        <p className="custom-p">
          <strong>Task Lighting:</strong> Focused lighting used in areas that require specific activities, such as
          reading, writing, or computer work. Common in office spaces, meeting rooms, and workstations.
        </p>
        <p className="custom-p">
          <strong>Accent Lighting:</strong> Used to draw attention to design features, artwork, textures, or branding
          elements. Accent lights help create visual interest and depth in a space.
        </p>
        <p className="custom-p">
          <strong>Decorative Lighting:</strong> Lighting fixtures that also serve as design elements. Chandeliers,
          pendant lights, or designer lamps can reinforce the aesthetic of a space.
        </p>

        <h2 className="custom-h2">How Lighting Enhances Interior Fit-Outs</h2>
        <ul className="space-y-2 list-disc list-inside">
          <li className="custom-p">
            <strong>Improves Functionality:</strong> A well-lit environment helps employees perform tasks more
            efficiently and safely. In retail spaces, effective lighting guides customer movement and highlights
            products.
          </li>
          <li className="custom-p">
            <strong>Enhances Aesthetic Appeal:</strong> Lighting plays a major role in the perception of space. It can
            make rooms feel larger, more open, or more intimate depending on the design and layout.
          </li>
          <li className="custom-p">
            <strong>Supports Branding:</strong> Color temperature, fixture style, and intensity can all reflect a
            brand’s personality. For example, cool white lighting may work for a modern tech firm, while warm lighting
            suits a luxury retail space.
          </li>
          <li className="custom-p">
            <strong>Boosts Employee Well-Being:</strong> Natural and well-planned artificial lighting reduces eye
            fatigue and supports circadian rhythms. This contributes to better health and higher employee morale.
          </li>
          <li className="custom-p">
            <strong>Increases Energy Efficiency:</strong> Modern LED lighting systems and smart lighting controls help
            reduce energy costs while providing flexibility in usage.

          business goals.
