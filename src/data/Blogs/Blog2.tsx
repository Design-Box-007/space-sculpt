From luxury residential projects to innovative commercial spaces, materials play a pivotal role in shaping the environment. As sustainability becomes a key priority in Dubai, finding a balance between elegance and eco-consciousness has led to the rise of new, sustainable materials alongside traditional choices like marble and wood."}</p>
      
      <h2 className="text-3xl md:text-4xl text-[#000000] font-medium">{"Traditional Materials vs. Modern Alternatives:"}</h2>
      
      <p className="text-base md:text-lg text-gray-600 font-medium">{"Dubai’s interior fit-outs have historically been characterized by the use of luxurious materials like marble, granite, and wood. While these materials exude elegance, there’s a growing shift towards more sustainable options without compromising quality and style."}</p>
      
      <ul>
        <p className="text-base md:text-lg text-gray-600 font-medium"><b className="text-black">{"Marble and Granite:"}</b> {"Marble remains a favorite for luxury interiors, offering a timeless and sophisticated look. It is widely used for flooring, countertops, and wall cladding. However, marble is a natural stone, and while it is durable, its environmental impact during extraction and transportation has led some to look for greener options."}</p>
        <p className="text-base md:text-lg text-gray-600 font-medium"><b className="text-black">{"Wood:"}</b> {"Wood brings warmth and natural beauty to spaces, especially in high-end homes and offices. In Dubai’s climate, however, choosing locally sourced or reclaimed wood is a more sustainable alternative to exotic hardwoods that have higher carbon footprints."}</p>
      </ul>
      
      <h2 className="text-3xl md:text-4xl text-[#000000] font-medium">{"Sustainable Materials Gaining Popularity in Dubai:"}</h2>

      <ul className='space-y-4'>
        <p className="text-base md:text-lg text-gray-600 font-medium"><b className="text-black">{"Bamboo:"}</b> {"Known for its sustainability and rapid growth, bamboo is now widely used in flooring, furniture, and wall panels. It’s strong, lightweight, and has a unique, natural appeal."}</p>
        <p className="text-base md:text-lg text-gray-600 font-medium"><b className="text-black">{"Recycled Materials:"}</b> {"Recycled glass, metal, and concrete are becoming popular choices in Dubai’s interior fit-outs. These materials help reduce waste and have a much smaller environmental impact."}</p>
        <p className="text-base md:text-lg text-gray-600 font-medium"><b className="text-black">{"Cork:"}</b> {"Cork is a renewable material used in flooring, furniture, and even wall coverings. It’s durable, lightweight, and adds an organic touch to interiors."}</p>
        <p className="text-base md:text-lg text-gray-600 font-medium"><b className="text-black">{"Eco-Friendly Paints and Finishes:"}</b> {"Low-VOC paints and finishes help improve indoor air quality while providing a polished look. These products are becoming the standard for both residential and commercial fit-outs, helping reduce harmful emissions."}</p>
      </ul>
      
      <h2 className="text-3xl md:text-4xl text-[#000000] font-medium">{"Conclusion:"}</h2>
